# Data_Analysis_Exercise

This project analyzes the visitation of stores made by users, given GPS signals of users, and outline of the stores (referred to as polygons). It also explores the demo-behavioural relationship between user affinities and specific stores they have visited. The datasets contains randomly selected data for the period of January 1st 2021 to January 21st 20121. A copy of the jupyter notebook has been provided and a powerpoint presentation was shared to show a detailed analysis of the data.

## What Software Do you Need?

To complete this project, you will require the following softwares:

• Python

•Jupyter Notebook

• A text editor e.g. Sublime or Atom

• A terminal application

### The Files You will need : 

• sample datasets

• stores.csv

• Affinity datasets



# Data Description

## GPS signals
GPS data can be found in sample_signals.zip archives. The GPS Data is partitioned into chunks and each chunk has the same format.

## Store polygons
The Data for Store polygons is located in the stores.csv file.

## Affinities
This data set relates to the belonging of a user to a specific demographics, interest, or consumption group.
For example: is a user a male? Is a user a female? Does a user likes McDonald’s? etc.
Data can be found in the affinities folder. Each affinity dataset is a collection of device ids, i.e. users, that belong to a specific group.
